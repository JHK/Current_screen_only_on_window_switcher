# 'Current screen only' for Aternate Tab

This is a Gnome Shell extension. It allows to cycle through windows (Alt+Tab) filtered per monitor.

It depends on the Alternate Tab extension - which provide the cycling through windows instead of applications, and filters the windows shown to those of the current monitor.
