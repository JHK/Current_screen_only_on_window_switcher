# 'Current screen only' for Aternate Tab

This is a Gnome Shell extension. It allows to cycle through windows (Alt+Tab) filtered per monitor.

It depends on the Alternate Tab extension - which provide the cycling through windows instead of applications, and filters the windows shown to those of the current monitor.

You can enable it from its page on the Gnome extensions site: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1437/current-screen-only-for-alternate-tab/
